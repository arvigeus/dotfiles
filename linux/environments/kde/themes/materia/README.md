## Importing Latte Theme

To import the themes into Latte Dock you must run Latte Dock and then right click on any part of the Dock, then "Layouts" and "Manage Layouts", when the window opens look for "Import" click and Search where you have saved your downloaded theme file; now double click on the "In Menu" part, so you have access from the menu without opening the "Manage Layouts" window at any time, and that's all. Now you can enjoy any theme you like.
